Herb & Bloom is Londonâ€™s most central Vertical farm. We grow microgreens and
microherbs, which are plants in their infancy, this means they deliver a far
more potent concentration of flavours and nutrient content. Our central
London location means you will struggle to find food that is fresher than
this. Loved by chefs and foodies for the vibrancy and flavour they add, they
are fast growing in popularity with the public for all that makes them so
interesting, nutritional, tasty and sustainable.

At Herb & Bloom we use state of the art vertical farming technology to
deliver the very best quality microgreens to the London community.

Using the agricultural systems of the future, we put technology at the
forefront of our innovation and development, allowing us to grow fresh
produce, from seed, right in the heart of the city.
